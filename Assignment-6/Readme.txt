CSS Grid Layout:

Purpose: CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layout. It's ideal for creating grid-based designs where you have rows and columns, making it well-suited for complex layouts.
Main Features:
Grid Container: The parent element with display: grid; defines the grid layout.
Grid Items: The children of the grid container are placed within the grid cells.
Grid Rows and Columns: You can define the size and structure of rows and columns using properties like grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns.
Gap: You can set the gap between rows and columns using the grid-gap property.
Use Cases: CSS Grid is great for creating complex, multi-dimensional layouts like magazine-style designs, responsive grids, and aligning content within a grid.

CSS Flexbox Layout:

Purpose: CSS Flexbox (short for Flexible Box) is designed for one-dimensional layout, mainly for distributing space along a single row or column. It's perfect for creating dynamic and responsive layouts.
Main Features:
Flex Container: The parent element with display: flex; defines the flex layout.
Flex Items: The children of the flex container become flexible items that can grow or shrink within the container.
Main Axis and Cross Axis: Flexbox has a main axis (either horizontal or vertical) and a cross axis. You control the layout along the main axis.
Flex Properties: You can control the sizing and behavior of flex items using properties like flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
Use Cases: Flexbox is best suited for aligning elements within a single row or column, centering content, and creating navigation bars or card layouts. It's particularly useful for responsive designs.


Sass features and concepts:

Variables: Sass allows you to define variables to store values that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheets. For example, you can store colors, font sizes, or other property values in variables.

Custom Properties: Also known as CSS variables, custom properties allow you to define values in your stylesheet that can be reused across your CSS, similar to Sass variables, but at the CSS level.

Nesting: In Sass, you can nest your CSS rules to make your code more organized and easier to read. This mimics the structure of your HTML and helps maintain a clear hierarchy.

Interpolation: Interpolation allows you to insert the value of a Sass variable into a property. You use #{$variable} to interpolate a variable within a property.

Placeholder Selectors: A placeholder selector, denoted with %, is a reusable block of CSS. You can use @extend to apply these styles to other elements in your stylesheet without generating redundant code.

Mixins: Mixins are reusable blocks of styles and can accept parameters. You use @mixin to define a mixin and @include to apply it to an element.

Functions: Sass supports custom functions that allow you to perform calculations, manipulate colors, and more. You can define your own functions or use built-in ones.

@extend: @extend allows you to inherit styles from another selector or placeholder selector. It's a way to share common styles between selectors.

@include: @include is used to include a mixin in a selector, allowing you to apply the styles defined in the mixin to the selected element.

round(): round() is a built-in function in Sass used to round a number to the nearest whole number.

if...else: Sass supports conditional statements using @if, @else if, and @else. You can use these statements to control the flow of your styles based on conditions.

adjust-hue(): adjust-hue() is a built-in function that allows you to adjust the hue of a color. You can make colors brighter or darker by changing their hue values.

Sass is a powerful CSS preprocessor that enhances the capabilities of standard CSS and makes stylesheets more maintainable and efficient. It provides features for creating modular and reusable styles, making it a popular choice for web developers.
